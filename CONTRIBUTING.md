# How to contribute
The gatling gradle plugin was originally written for one of CommerceHub's product teams. Because of this, specific features
were included during the plugin's initial development. If your project requires any feature(s) that aren't included feel free
to submit a pull request.

Fork and clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:you-username/repo.git

Make sure tests / CodeNarc pass:

    ./gradle(w) build

Make your change, add tests for your change, and make sure all tests still pass:

    ./gradle(w) build

Push to your forked repo and submit your pull request.

To increase the chance of your pull request's acceptance:

* Write tests
* Write detailed commit messages
* Include documentation for any added features
